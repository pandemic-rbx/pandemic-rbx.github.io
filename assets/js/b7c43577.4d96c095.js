MarkerMap should be a folder which is a node map created by the Node Map V2\\nplugin. It will be used to create markers which will guide to the position of `Location`.\\nWhen you set `MarkerPositions` or `MarkerParts`, it will override any markers which were already set,\\nexcept for `MarkerMap` markers. While `MarkerMap` is set, it will always take priority.\\n### Progress Formatting\\nDifferent objective types have their own default progress format. You can override this with the\\n`ProgressFormat` property. If you wanted display Z$ for example, you could use:\\n```lua\\nobjective.ProgressFormat = \\"Z$%d\\"\\n```\\nThis would format whatever the value of `Progress` is with this string.","source":{"line":124,"path":"src/Objective/init.lua"}}')}}]);
